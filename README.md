# Adidas-Sales-Analysis

This project involves analyzing Adidas sales data using Pandas and Python, alongside a Power BI Dashboard for data visualization. The goal is to explore key insights from the sales data, identify trends, and provide actionable business recommendations. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as sales distribution, product performance, correlation between variables, and identifying the best times to sell different product categories.
Project Overview
This project explores a dataset containing Adidas retail sales data across different product categories, retailers, and locations. The goal is to uncover insights that can help optimize sales strategies, inventory management, and marketing efforts for Adidas. The analysis has been enhanced with a Power BI Dashboard for interactive data visualization.

# Data Analysis Tasks
The following analysis tasks have been performed:

# 1. Total Sales Distribution
Analyzed the distribution of total sales across all products and retailers to identify sales patterns and performance.
# 2. Price Distribution of Products
Examined how product prices vary and their impact on total sales and profit margins.
# 3. Retailer Sales Performance
Analyzed the sales contribution of each retailer to the total sales, highlighting the top-performing and least-performing retailers.
# 4. Correlation Between Variables
Explored the correlation between Units Sold, Total Sales, and Operating Profit to understand how sales volume impacts overall profit.
# 5. Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)
Identified the retailers contributing to 80% of total sales to apply the Pareto principle for business strategy.
# 6. Best Time to Sell Product Categories
Analyzed sales trends over time (monthly, quarterly) to determine the best months for selling each product category.
# 7. Peak and Slow Sales Months
Determined the peak and slow sales months to understand seasonality and optimize marketing campaigns.
# 8. Sales Trends Over Time
Analyzed sales data over time to identify sales growth or decline and key trends for different product categories.

# Power BI Dashboard
A Power BI Dashboard has been created to visualize key metrics and trends derived from the sales data. The dashboard includes the following features:

Total Sales by Product Category

Total Sales by Region, State, and City

Top and Bottom Performers (Retailers, Products)
Sales Trends Over Time (Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly)

Sales Distribution by Price per Unit and Operating Profit

Key Features of the Dashboard:
Interactive filters for product categories, regions, and time periods.
Visualizations that highlight sales performance across different dimensions (e.g., price per unit, units sold, operating profit).
Trend charts that show sales and profit margins over time, helping to identify peak sales periods.
Key Insights
High Performing Products: Certain products and retailers contribute significantly to the overall sales and profit margins.
Sales Trends: Certain months show peaks in sales, indicating seasonality or promotional effects.
Retailer Performance: Some retailers significantly outperform others, contributing to the majority of sales.
Correlation: A positive correlation exists between higher product prices and higher profit margins, indicating that premium-priced products tend to generate higher profits.
Technologies Used
Data Analysis: Pandas, Python
Data Visualization: Power BI
